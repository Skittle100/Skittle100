🤖 AI Developer's Playground
Welcome to this AI project, where code sometimes works, and AI occasionally makes decisions no one understands. This repo runs on a mix of machine learning, bad jokes, and an unhealthy amount of debugging.

❓ Why does this exist?
Because AI won’t build itself (yet). Here you’ll find experiments, algorithmic chaos, and maybe something accidentally useful.

🛠 Installation (at your own risk)
Clone the repo like a true hacker:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository.git  

Enter the void:
cd repository  

Summon dependencies:
npm install  # or pip install -r requirements.txt  

🚀 How to use it?
Launch the AI and hope for the best:
npm start  # or python main.py  

🧠 Tech stack (or at least the intention)
🤯 Neural networks (with a mind of their own)
⚡ APIs (because reinventing the wheel is exhausting)
🐛 Debugging (lots and lots of debugging)
🤝 Want to contribute?
Go ahead! Just know that the AI is silently judging your code. Open a pull request, and let's make this even weirder.
